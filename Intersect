--A simple but powerful keyword, Intersect allows us to compare two datasets and only return the records existing in both

--Example:

SELECT
    city
FROM
    sales.customers t1
    
INTERSECT

SELECT
    city
FROM
    sales.stores t2
ORDER BY
    city;
    
--This would only return cities where customers and stores both exist
