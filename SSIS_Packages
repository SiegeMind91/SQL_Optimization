Packages are a helpful way to contain a process for getting specific data. 

Straight from the Microsoft Documentation:
"A package is an organized collection of connections, control flow elements, data flow elements, event handlers, 
  variables, parameters, and configurations, that you assemble using either the graphical design tools that SQL 
  Server Integration Services provides, or build programmatically."

We can create them in SSIS (Sql Server Integration Services), a type of project inside Visual Studio. 

Each package has a number of things that it may contain including;
  + Tasks & Containers - This is your Control Flow
    - These execute when the package runs and can be called repeatedly if necessary
  + Data Sources and Destinations - This is your Data Flow
    - These are the heart of your ETL, Extract from a Source, Transform the data, Load to the Destination
    - Before you can add data to a package, it must have a data flow
  + Connection Managers - This is where your connections are stored
    - Each package usually has at least one to manage the properties of your package
