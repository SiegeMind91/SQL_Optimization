Using SSIS 

We can use SSMS to interact with and execute the SSIS packages. 
In order to do so you'll need to open SSMS as an administrator and then connect to the server that holds the pacakges we want to interact with. 

In order to design packages, we'll need to have SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) installed. 
Generally, you're going to use this as a component of Visual Studio. 
During the VS installation, you'll be given the opportunity to select which workloads you're going to expect to use with VS. In this section, you'll 
    want to choose 'Data storage and processing' to ensure SSDT is installed as well. 
We're not done there though, we also need to make sure that the SSIS extension is added with the VS install. 
    To do so, click the extensions drop down at the top of VS, then click Manage Extensions. 
    Then go to the 'Online' option, and search for 'SQL Server Integration Services Projects' and download it. 

One important thing to note is the package that will be executed by SQL Server, Package.dtsx.
