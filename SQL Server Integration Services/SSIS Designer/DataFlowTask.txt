Data Flow Task 

Unlike other tasks, when we double click on this task in our design surface it will not open a new form window, but instead it will change our 
    design surface to the Data Flow view. It will also change the options available to us in the toolbox
Here we can see different sources for our data and common functions that we can apply to the data 

Adding a Source Assistant will give us the options for bringing in data from a myriad of sources.
Once our source is selected and configured, we can double click on the chosen source and select the table(s) we want to touch. 
    We can select entire tables/views, or we can write our own SQL command for more complex queries 

Adding a Destination Assistant will give us options for where we want that data to go. 
Once our destination is selected and configured, we'll need to double click on it and select a table for where we want the data to go. 
    We can also choose to create a new table for the data.
