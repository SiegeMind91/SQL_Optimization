SQL Server Task 

This task helps us to link to a SQL script somewhere on our local machine or connected network drives. 
There are a couple of SQL statement options:
    + Execute SQL Task 
    + Execute T-SQL Task 
These options are very similar but with some key differences:
    + The T-SQL Task must use the T-SQL language and doesn't offer options for parameterized queries 
    + The regular SQL Task is more generalized and will accept most SQL languages as well as parameters
