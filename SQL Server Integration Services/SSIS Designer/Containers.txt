Containers

Containers can be used to better organize complex tasks, but they can also help with adding functionality to a process. 
    + For Loop containers can loop through a process until a certain condition is met 
    + Foreach Loop containers ensure that each piece has the operation carried out upon it 
    + Sequence containers simply group the tasks together into a single meaningful unit of work 

Containers aren't only for organizing or looping our tasks though, they can even become part of the precedence/constraint pathway themselves. 
We can move from one sequence container to another and giving the pathway it's own constraints on when to execute. 

In the Design Surface we can choose to disable a task or container if we're trying to debug or understand what causes some action to happen. 
We can also choose to execute the container individually without it running the next steps in the control flow
