--Temporary functions help us clean up our code and express logic in one place rather than in several

--If we use something like the below, yeah it works, but it can be hard to read especially if there's bad space formatting 
SELECT name
       , CASE WHEN tenure < 1 THEN "analyst"
              WHEN tenure BETWEEN 1 and 3 THEN "associate"
              WHEN tenure BETWEEN 3 and 5 THEN "senior"
              WHEN tenure > 5 THEN "vp"
              ELSE "n/a"
         END AS seniority 
FROM employees

--Or, we can leverage temporary functions and do something like this. Suddenly our select statement is much more readable and if we need to 
--    utilize the functionality of this case statement later, it's here for us.
