--Recursive CTEs are really useful in hierarcical data or any data set that can join on itself using a unique ID

WITH hierarchy AS (
   --This is called our anchor query, it returns the base that we'll build on
   SELECT id
          , manager_id
   FROM staff_members
   WHERE manager_id IS NULL --This is the termination condition, without this it will loop forever
   
   UNION ALL --The UNION ALL is what forces the query to be recursive, as long as the below returns a result, it will keep querying
   
   --The query that is executed recursively to give us a result
   SELECT sm.id
          , sm.manager_id
   FROM staff_members sm
