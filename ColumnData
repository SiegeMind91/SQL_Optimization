//Show Columns is the command you never knew you needed. It returns a table with the table and schema name as well as the column names and types. 
//The only downside to Show Columns is that it doesn't exist in SQL Server, but instead in Snowflake

//===========SNOWFLAKE
//Show Columns Example
SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE myDatabase.mySchema.myTable


//===========SQL SERVER
//SQL Server has its own version of show columns, it's just not as simple
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = N'Customers'

//SQL Server also allows you to grab all columns from all tables in a db
SELECT o.Name, c.Name
FROM sys.columns c 
  JOIN sys.objects o ON o.object_id = c.object_id 
WHERE o.type = 'U' --The type here is for tables only, but if you added WHERE o.type IN ('U', 'V') you could get all of the views as well
ORDER BY o.Name, c.Name


//===========ORACLE
//This is how you can do something similar in Oracle, and there are several options to replace column_name or table_name with
SELECT table_name, column_name 
FROM all_tab_columns 
WHERE column_name LIKE '%PTS%'
  OR column_name = 'ThisString'
;
