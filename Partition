//Partition Example
//Partitions allow us to section off groups of the data, based on a given parameter

//For example, let's suppose we had a table of sales agents and we wanted to see their rank of 
//	Total sales for a given timeframe:

SELECT *,
   RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Sales.Agent ORDER BY Sales.TotalRevenue DESC)
FROM (
	SELECT Transactions.Agent, Transactions.Revenue
        FROM BaseTransactionsTable 
     ) Sales


//We could also try to get the average time a truck driver spends on the road per day, per month
//	(Assuming that the table is set up by day)

SELECT Driver, TimeDriving,
   AVG(LogTable.TimeDriving) OVER(PARTITION BY LogTable.Driver, LogTable.Month) as AverageDriveTime
FROM LogTable


//You can basically think of it like a pivot table for SQL
//It's immensely useful, and will save you time in the long run
