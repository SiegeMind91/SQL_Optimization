//This is a quick guide to Joins - One of the most basic SQL keywords, but also one of the most powerful

//Left Join (Also called Left Outer Join)
//This type of join returns the table on the "Left" side of the join, and any matching records from the "Right" side
SELECT *
FROM TableA
  LEFT JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
  
//Inner Join
//This type of join returns only matching records from both tables
SELECT *
FROM TableA
  INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
  
//Right Join (Also called Right Outer Join)
//This type of join returns the table on the "Right" side of the join, and any matching records from the "Left" side
SELECT *
FROM TableA
  RIGHT JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
  
//Full Join (Also called Full Outer Join)
//This type of join returns all rows from both tables, regardless of match
SELECT * 
FROM TableA
  FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
  
//With the Right, Left, and Full Outer Joins we can also add a WHERE clause that changes the behavior slightly
//We can add a WHERE clause for NULL records to give us only the records that don't have a match
//Left Join Example:
SELECT *
FROM TableA
  LEFT JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
WHERE TableB.Key = NULL

//Full Outer Join Example:
SELECT * 
FROM TableA
  FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.Key = TableB.Key
WHERE TableA.Key = NULL AND TableB.Key = NULL
